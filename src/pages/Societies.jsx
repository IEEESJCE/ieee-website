        IEEE-SJCE Student Branch which started as an elite group 29 years ago,
        today has sprawled throughout the campus of SJCE, making the students
        technically more competitive, more professional and capable of enhancing
        their abilities as an engineer. Since then IEEE-SJCE STUDENT BRANCH, a
        division under Region 10 of IEEE has been known for the immensity with
        which its members were bestowed. The very success story of its students
        as professionals into their respective fields after graduations speaks
        of its standards.
        <br />
        <br />
        IEEE-SJCE now has about 330+ members from six fields of engineering:
        Biotechnology, Computer Science, Electronics & Communication, Electrical
        & Electronics, Information Science, and Instrumentation Technology.
        Apart from these many students from various post-graduation departments
        have also subscribed to be members.
        <br />
        <br />
        IEEE-SJCE conducts two annual technical fests - TUXEDO, a Linux fest
        during the odd semesters, and CYBERIA, the annual technical fest
        conducted during the even semesters. CYBERIA was instigated 19 years ago
        and has been organized for 18 years now. The events in the fest are so
        organized as to give students from all branches of engineering,
        irrespective of them being members or not, and irrespective of their
        branches, a chance to showcase their talents and abilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="/photos/events/student_branch.jpeg" alt="" className="img2" />
        To make students technically competitive, technical tests on C
        programming, microprocessors etc. are conducted. Various workshops and
        crash courses are also organized. An annual leadership workshop adorns
        the calendar of events every year, which helps the students to improve
        as leaders and inculcates the spirits of true leadership in them. Apart
        from this, extensive talks are organized by people representing
        industry, academia, and research as well.
        <br />
        <br />
        The standards of IEEE-SJCE was proven to be the best when it was awarded
        the Best Student Branch for the year 2003-2004. Among the competitors
        for this tag were the top colleges of VTU, Manipal Institute of
        Technology, and NITK; Surathkal as well.
        <br />
        <br />
        IEEE-SJCE is also proud of nurturing the IEEE-EDS STUDENT CHAPTER.
        IEEE-SJCE is the only student branch to have gained permission to start
        this chapter throughout India. IEEE-SJCE also has a Women in Engineering
        Student Chapter.

      <h4 className="societies_subheading">ABOUT US</h4>
      <p className="societies_p">
        <img src="/photos/events/EDS.jpg" alt="" className="img3" />
        IEEE-SJCE EDS has been providing students with basic electronics
        knowledge since its inception. It has helped students get better
        acquainted with electronic components, the various techniques of circuit
        making, and the basics of robot building.
      </p>

      <h4 className="societies_subheading">SNAP CIRCUIT</h4>
      <p className="societies_p">
        A Snap circuit product is a tool for entering the exciting world of
        electronics. Electronics play an increasingly important role in our
        everyday lives, and so it is important to have some basic knowledge of
        them. In this workshop, the students have a hands-on experience of basic
        electrical and electronics circuits. The workshop is conducted
        exclusively for first and second year students. The students are allowed
        to explore different circuits with the help of the manuals which come
        along with the kits under the supervision of volunteers.
      </p>

      <h4 className="societies_subheading">SOLDERING AND ETCHING WORKSHOP</h4>
      <p className="societies_p">
        Soldering is a concept used in every electronic appliance. It is
        necessary to know the proper soldering techniques. Keeping this in mind,
        IEEE-SJCE EDS conducts soldering and etching workshops in odd semesters,
        where senior IEEE EDS members teach the 2nd and 1st years. They make
        participants etch a simple circuit and solder it. The main highlights of
        the workshop were that the participants got to learn robotics from
        scratch and then move on to more advanced topics like
        Bluetooth-controlled robots, voice-controlled robots, DTMF-controlled
        robots, and even Android app-controlled robots.
      </p>

      <h4 className="societies_subheading">VACATION PROJECT MANIA</h4>
      <p className="societies_p">

        The famous adage of Jean Nicolas, "whatever we posses becomes of double
        value when we have the opportunity of sharing it with others" embodies
        the idea of conducting VPM. Vacation Project Mania, an initiative of
        IEEE-SJCE EDS is conducted during the vacations. VPM is an interactive
        session in which the seniors and juniors mingle together to share their
        knowledge, ideas, and most importantly, experiences, but the torch
        bearers of this successful mania are the seniors without a doubt. VPM
        gets a huge response from all circuit branches, around 120+ students
        attend the project sessions every day for 4 hours. VPM plays a prominent
        role in generating practical impulses in the minds of young budding
        engineers.
      </p>

      <h4 className="societies_subheading">ROBOTICS WORKSHOP</h4>
      <p className="societies_p">
        As they say, our knowledge is volatile until we apply the concept of our
        knowledge in a real-time situation. Hence, "Robotics", one of the
        biggest events in SJCE, is conducted annually by the IEEE-SJCE EDS
        Chapter. The workshop starts with building basic robots and ends with
        the participants being able to build robots that use collision avoidance
        and are controlled using mobile phones through DTMF.

        <b>IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE)</b> is a global network of IEEE
        members and volunteers dedicated to promoting women engineers and
        scientists and inspiring girls around the world to follow their academic
        interests in a career in engineering and science. It is the world’s
        largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing
        technology for the benefit of humanity. Its goal is to facilitate the
        recruitment and retention of women in technical disciplines globally.
        IEEE WIE envisions a vibrant community of IEEE women and men
        collectively using their diverse talents to innovate for the benefit of
        humanity.
        <br />
        <br />
        The idea of a WIE chapter in the IEEE-SJCE student branch was conceived
        and implemented only a couple of years ago. Since its inception, the
        chapter has been responsible for several activities and initiatives. WIE
        team has made frequent visits to several organizations to reach out to
        underprivileged children and educate them about their chances in
        engineering.
        <br />
        <br />
        IEEE-SJCE WIE also organises distinguished lectures by women
        professionals who help in encouraging young girls to strive hard and
        motivate them in achieving excellence in academics and profession. Apart
        from this, the WIE chapter of the student branch is also involved in
        organising technical competitions and workshops. The team intends to
        continue these activities along with the implementation of newer ideas.
