          Web Development board, an important wing of IEEE-SJCE is an exclusive
          committee for designing and maintaining the website and web pages of
          IEEE-SJCE, its events, and spread its motto. For us, WDB is a place
          where students from various disciplines of the campus meet together to
          put their creativity to work and design web pages and host them on the
          web securely.

          It also encourages the students on the campus to learn languages for
          web hosting like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTML(server-side scripting) by
          conducting many technical sessions on them throughout the year, which
          are hosted by our core committee members.

          Over the years, WDB has turned in to be an integral part of
          IEEE-SJCE, due to the growing importance of the web in recent years as
          it is shaping up as the best source of information. We, at WDB, hope
          to strengthen the knowledge of web designing and hosting among the
          students to a greater extent and work as a team to bring in web pages
          to create zing and get an overwhelming response from the people in our
          organization and its events.
